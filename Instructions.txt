Instructions for the Exception Project

This assumes you havepleted Program Challenge 1 of Chapter 15 (Employee and PreoductionWorker Classes). Modify the Employee and Production Worker classes so they throw exceptions when the following error occur:
•The Employee class should throw an exception named InvalidEmployeeNumber when it recieves an employee number that is less that 0 or greated than 9999.
•The ProductionWorker class should throw an exception named InvalidShift when it receives an invalid shift.
•The ProductionWorker class should throw an exception named InvalidPayRate when it receives a negative number for the hourly pay rate.
Write a driver program that demonstrates how each of these exceptions conditions works.


Employee class
Design a class named Employee. The class should keep the following information:
•Employee name
•Employee number
•Hire date
Write one or more constructors, and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions, for the class.

ProductionWorker class
Write a class named ProductionWorker that is derived from the Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should have member variables to hold the following information:
•Shift (an integer)
•Hourly pay rate (a double)
The day shift is 1, and the night shift is 2. Write one or more constructors, and the appropriate accesor and mutator functions, for the class.
